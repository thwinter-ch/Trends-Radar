# Prompt: Tech Trends Launch Post

## Context

We've analyzed 16 major tech trend reports for 2026 (Google Cloud, Deloitte, Gartner, Forrester, a16z, MIT TR, Mary Meeker, Prof Galloway, etc.) and synthesized them into a single repository with:

- Bias detection for each report
- Cross-report pattern analysis
- Consensus vs. disagreement tracking
- Open methodology on GitHub

## Objective

Create a LinkedIn post that:
- Announces the Trends Radar repository
- Positions it as antidote to vendor hype
- Shows we've done the work (16 reports, open methodology)
- Drives to the GitHub repo
- Professional tone but sharp/contrarian edge

## Target Audience

- Tech executives making 2026 strategy decisions
- VCs/founders tracking trend consensus
- Anyone tired of reading vendor pitches disguised as thought leadership

## Key Points to Hit

1. The problem: Trend reports are sales pitches
2. What we built: Open analysis with explicit bias detection
3. The value: See consensus, disagreement, and who's selling what
4. The format: GitHub because version-controlled intelligence > rotting slides

## Tone

Direct, credible, slightly contrarian. No hype. No emojis unless they add signal.
