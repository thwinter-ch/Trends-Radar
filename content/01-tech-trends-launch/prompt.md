# Prompt: Tech Trends 2026 LinkedIn Post

## Context Given

- Tech Trends 2026 collection completed (22 reports, 16 publishers)
- Bias scoring framework applied to all reports
- Theme: why GitHub for business intelligence / Second Brain
- Built with Claude Code + Perplexity MCP
- Target audience: business/tech leaders doing AI knowledge work

## Key Inputs

- Full synthesis: `tech-2026/README.md`
- Brand narrative from `~/.claude/skills/_shared/brand-narrative.md`
- LinkedIn skill formatting rules
- Previous WEF post as tone reference

## Iterations

1. **Draft 1** — Meta-pattern lead (quote too long for hook)
2. **Draft 2** — Numbers lead (22/16/Zero — selected)
3. **Draft 3** — Contrarian hook ("biggest lie" — too aggressive)

## User Feedback

- "Zero objectivity" too aggressive → changed to "Everyone has an agenda"
- Wanted more on WHY GitHub specifically:
  - Built with Claude Code + Perplexity MCP
  - Repo = natural home for agentic workflows
  - Web chat loses context; repo IS the context
- Wanted emojis (tasteful, as structure markers)

## Final Adjustments

- Softened hook
- Added Claude Code + MCP credibility line
- Expanded GitHub rationale with 5 concrete benefits
- "repo IS the context" as central insight
- Link in comments (LinkedIn algorithm)
