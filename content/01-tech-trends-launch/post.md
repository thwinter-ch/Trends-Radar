# Tech Trends 2026 — LinkedIn Post

## Post

```
22 trend reports.
16 publishers.
Everyone has an agenda.

🔍 I built a bias-scored synthesis of every major 2026 tech prediction.

Google Cloud? HIGH bias — every trend = GCP product.
a16z? HIGH bias — every idea = portfolio thesis.
MIT Tech Review? LOW bias — actual editorial independence.

The meta-pattern:
Vendors sell products. Consultants sell complexity. VCs sell exits.
Only Forrester, Galloway, and MIT mention what might NOT happen.

🧠 This is part of my Second Brain initiative.

Built with Claude Code + a Perplexity MCP for deep research.
And here's what I learned about AI-assisted knowledge work:

When you build with agentic tools, a repo becomes the natural home.

Why?

💬 Web chat interfaces lose context after every session
📁 A repo IS the context — persistent, structured, always available
📥 Plain text that any AI can ingest and reason over
🔄 New report drops → add it → corpus compounds
🍴 Forkable — disagree with my bias scores? Clone it and challenge them

Slides rot in inboxes.
Git compounds in public.

If you're doing serious knowledge work with AI in 2026, think in repos, not chat windows.
