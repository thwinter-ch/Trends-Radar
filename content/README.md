# Content Strategy

Content pieces built from the analysis. Each folder contains the post, the prompt used to generate it, and any supporting assets.

This directory is intentionally not linked from the root README—it's here for transparency, not promotion.

## Folder Structure

Each content piece follows this pattern:

```
[number]-[slug]/
├── post.md          # Final LinkedIn post
├── prompt.md        # Prompt used to generate the post
└── assets/          # Images, exports, supporting files
```

---

## Principles

- **Show the work:** Prompts are transparent
- **Version-controlled:** Content strategy evolves like code
- **Not the headline:** This directory exists but isn't promoted
- **Forkable:** Anyone can clone the approach
