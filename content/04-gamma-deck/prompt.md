# Prompt: Tech Trends 2026 Carousel

## Gamma Prompt

Copy this into Gamma to generate the carousel deck:

```
Create a LinkedIn carousel deck (10-12 slides) about Tech Trends 2026 analysis.

CONTEXT:
I analyzed 22 tech trend reports from major publishers (Google, Deloitte, Gartner, a16z, Forrester, Microsoft, BCG, ARK Invest, MIT Tech Review, Mary Meeker, Prof Galloway, etc.) and scored them for commercial bias.

KEY CONTENT TO INCLUDE:

Slide 1 (Hook):
"22 trend reports. 16 publishers. Everyone has an agenda."
Subtitle: What I learned reading every major 2026 tech prediction

Slide 2 (The Meta-Pattern):
- Vendors sell products
- Consultants sell complexity
- VCs sell exits
- Only independents mention what might NOT happen

Slide 3 (Bias Scoring - HIGH):
HIGH BIAS publishers (read for product direction, not truth):
- Google Cloud — every trend = GCP product
- Microsoft — Copilot roadmap as thought leadership
- a16z — portfolio thesis dressed as trends
- IBM — quantum hype + sovereignty positioning
- ARK Invest — ETF holdings justification

Slide 4 (Bias Scoring - LOW):
LOW BIAS publishers (most trustworthy signal):
- MIT Technology Review — editorial independence
- Mary Meeker — data-driven, no product to sell
- Prof Galloway — contrarian, surfaces vendor blind spots

Slide 5 (Consensus #1 - Agentic AI):
EVERYONE agrees: Agentic AI is THE story of 2026
But only Forrester warns about risks (breach prediction)

Slide 6 (Consensus #2 - Infrastructure):
AI Infrastructure is now a C-suite problem
- Computation = CEO-level strategic conversation
- Power grid can't keep up (Galloway's unique insight)

Slide 7 (Consensus #3 - ROI Reckoning):
The ROI Reckoning is coming
- Forrester: 25% of AI spend deferred to 2027
- Vendors hate this narrative — that's how you know it's real

Slide 8 (What Vendors Won't Say):
Things only independents mention:
- China competition (DeepSeek: 0% → 21% LLM share)
- AI stock correction risk
- Power grid constraints
- Humanoids overhyped, industrial robots win

Slide 9 (How to Read Trend Reports):
Read vendors for: product direction
Read consultants for: frameworks
Read independents for: reality checks
Read aggregators for: consensus tracking

Slide 10 (The System):
Built with Claude Code + Perplexity MCP
All 22 reports analyzed with consistent methodology
Bias-scored, cross-referenced, synthesized
Open source on GitHub

Slide 11 (CTA):
Full analysis: github.com/thwinter-ch/Trends-Radar
Fork it. Challenge it. Build your own.

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Clean, minimal, dark or light professional theme
- One key point per slide
- Large text, high contrast
- No stock photos — use simple icons or data visualizations if needed
- Mobile-optimized (will be viewed as LinkedIn carousel)
