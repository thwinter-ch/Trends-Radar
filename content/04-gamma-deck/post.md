# Tech Trends 2026 Carousel — LinkedIn Post

## Post (accompanies carousel)

```
I read 22 tech trend reports so you don't have to.

Google. Deloitte. Gartner. a16z. Forrester. Microsoft. BCG. ARK. MIT. Meeker. Galloway.

The whole 2026 prediction circus.

Here's what I found:

🎯 The meta-pattern is brutal:
Vendors sell products. Consultants sell complexity. VCs sell exits.
Only the independents mention what might NOT happen.

📊 I scored every report for commercial bias.
HIGH bias: Google, Microsoft, a16z, IBM, ARK
LOW bias: MIT Tech Review, Meeker, Galloway

Swipe through for the breakdown →

What surprised me most:
Everyone agrees on agentic AI.
Almost nobody talks about China competition.
Only Galloway mentions the power grid can't keep up.

The full analysis is open source — bias framework, methodology, all 22 reports.
