# Prompt: AI-Powered Knowledge Repo LinkedIn Post

## Context Given

- Meta post about building the Trends Radar repo itself
- Theme: AI building beyond code, knowledge architecture
- Built with Claude Code + Perplexity MCP
- Target audience: people curious about AI but think "building" means coding
- Position as AI builder

## Key Inputs

- METHODOLOGY.md — ingestion process, templates, bias framework
- JOURNEY.md — problem statement, design decisions
- Brand narrative from `~/.claude/skills/_shared/brand-narrative.md`
- LinkedIn skill formatting rules
- Previous WEF and Tech Trends posts as tone reference

## Iterations

1. **Draft 1** — "AI Builder" redefinition hook (too abstract)
2. **Draft 2** — Learnings-first hook (list-heavy)
3. **Draft 3** — Problem/solution hook (selected)

## User Feedback

- Don't criticize Notion (user uses it) → changed to OneNote
- Add the structured ingestion process (discover → analyze → synthesize)
- Point to multiple entry points in comments (repo, methodology, journey)

## Final Adjustments

- Added "The process" section with 3-step loop
- Multiple links in first comment
- "Stop chatting. Start building." as closing CTA
