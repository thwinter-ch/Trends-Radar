# AI-Powered Knowledge Repo — LinkedIn Post

## Post

```
I got tired of losing my research.

Every AI chat session: brilliant insights, then poof — gone.
Every Google Drive folder: good intentions, then rot.
Every OneNote notebook: starts clean, dies messy.

So I built something different.

🧠 An AI-powered knowledge repo.

The stack:
→ Claude Code as the orchestrator
→ Perplexity MCP for deep research
→ GitHub as the persistent brain

The process:
→ Discover new sources (automated search)
→ Analyze each with a consistent template
→ Update the synthesis — patterns emerge across reports

The output:
→ 22 tech trend reports analyzed with bias scoring
→ WEF Davos 2026 tracked day-by-day
→ Methodology documented, forkable, challengeable

Why GitHub?

📁 A repo IS the context — every AI session can read it
🔄 New source drops → add it → corpus compounds
📜 Version-controlled thinking — see how analysis evolved
🍴 Open by default — fork it, challenge it, make it yours

This isn't coding. It's knowledge architecture with AI tools.

The whole system is public. Methodology included.

If you're doing serious knowledge work in 2026, stop chatting.
Start building.
