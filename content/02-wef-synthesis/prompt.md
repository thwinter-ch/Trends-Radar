# Prompt: WEF Synthesis LinkedIn Post

## Context Given

- WEF Davos 2026 synthesis completed and stored on GitHub
- Theme: why GitHub literacy matters for AI work in 2026
- Point to the Trends-Radar repo
- Target audience: business/tech leaders curious about AI trends
- Use LinkedIn skill for formatting

## Key Inputs

- Full synthesis: `wef-2026/2026-wef-davos-synthesis.md`
- Daily summaries in `wef-2026/daily/`
- Brand narrative from `~/.claude/skills/_shared/brand-narrative.md`
- LinkedIn skill formatting rules

## Iterations

1. **Draft 1** — Operator/Build angle (too short, generic)
2. **Draft 2** — Contrarian/Sharp angle (strongest hook, selected for expansion)
3. **Draft 3** — Direct/Shortest angle (too brief)

## User Feedback on Draft 2

- Liked direction but too short
- Wanted emojis (tasteful)
- Wanted to call out AI project for knowledge collection
- Connect to Second Brain initiative
- Personal knowledge shared in public
- GitHub as natural home for this workflow

## Final Adjustments

- Expanded with Second Brain framing
- Added 3 emojis as signal (🧠📂🔄)
- Link in comments (LinkedIn algorithm suppresses external links in main post)
- Screenshot of GitHub README suggested as optional image
