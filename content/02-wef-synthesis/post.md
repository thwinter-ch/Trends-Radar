## Post

850 private jets.
4 climate sessions.
3,000 billionaires now exist globally.

WEF Davos 2026 is done.

🧠 I tracked it as an AI project.

Every day: Perplexity deep research → synthesis → Markdown.
Four days of geopolitics, AI timelines, and elite theatre—captured, structured, integrated.

This is part of my Second Brain initiative.
Personal knowledge management, built in public.
Not hoarded in some app. Shared on GitHub.

Why GitHub?

Because AI doesn't work with your filing cabinet.
It works with structured, version-controlled, plain-text knowledge.

Every serious AI workflow I build starts the same way:
Markdown files. Git commits. Context that compounds.

📂 Google Drive is where knowledge goes to die.
🔄 GitHub is where it compounds.

If you're planning to do anything meaningful with AI in 2026, GitHub literacy isn't optional anymore.

It's not about being a developer.
It's about building a knowledge system that AI can actually use.
