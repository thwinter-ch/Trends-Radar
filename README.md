# Trends Radar

Tech trend reports decoded. Every January, everyone publishes predictions. Most are product pitches. We collect them, detect the bias, extract the signal, and synthesize what actually matters.

## What This Is

An opinionated collection and analysis of trend reports from consultancies, tech giants, analysts, and institutions. We read the reports so you don't have to — and tell you what they're really selling.

## Current Scans

| Collection | Status | Integrated Synthesis |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| [Tech Trends 2026](tech-2026/) | In Progress | [Summary](tech-2026/README.md) |
| [WEF Davos 2026](wef-2026/) | Pending | [Summary](wef-2026/README.md) |

## How We Work

1. **Collect** — Sweep known publishers, use Perplexity to find what we missed
2. **Analyze** — Read each report with explicit bias detection
3. **Document** — Per-source interpretation with commercial angle
4. **Synthesize** — Cross-report integration, agreement/disagreement patterns

Every report gets the same treatment:
- What are they claiming?
- What are they selling?
- What's genuinely useful?

## Philosophy

> "When a consultancy tells you what the future looks like, ask who's paying for the vision."

Most trend reports exist to position products, create consulting urgency, or establish thought leadership. That doesn't make them useless — the underlying research is often solid. But the framing serves commercial interests. We read them critically and note the bias explicitly.
