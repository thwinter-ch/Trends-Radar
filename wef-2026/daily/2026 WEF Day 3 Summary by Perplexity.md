# WEF Annual Meeting 2026 – Davos – January 22, 2026 Summary

## 1. Geopolitical Dimensions

**Trump-Canada Rift and Gaza Board Fallout**

On January 22, Trump publicly withdrew Canada's invitation to his newly launched "Board of Peace" to oversee Gaza reconstruction after Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered critical remarks at Davos on January 20 about economic coercion by great powers. Trump responded sharply during his January 21 address: "I watched your Prime Minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful… Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements." Carney fired back, asserting: "But Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian." In a formal Truth Social letter, Trump wrote: "The Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time."[^1][^2]

**Ukraine-Russia Peace Talks Near Resolution**

US Envoy Steve Witkoff announced significant diplomatic progress on January 22, stating negotiations have narrowed to "one issue" and that it is "resolvable." Following his meeting with Trump at Davos on January 22, President Zelenskyy announced trilateral talks beginning January 24 in the UAE involving Ukraine, Russia, and the US. Zelenskyy stated that "documents aimed at ending this war are nearly nearly ready" and emphasized that "Russia must be prepared for compromises" if a resolution is to occur. He warned that Europeans "should not degrade ourselves to secondary roles" and called on the continent to "stop living in a Groundhog Day loop" of endless deliberation without action.[^3][^4][^5]

**European Shift Toward India and Rearmament**

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU is "on the cusp of a historic trade agreement" with India, describing it as the "mother of all deals," which would create a market of 2 billion people representing nearly a quarter of global GDP. She plans to travel to India the weekend after Davos to finalize discussions. Von der Leyen declared: "Europe needs an urgency mindset" and emphasized "nostalgia will not bring back the old order." The EU is simultaneously pursuing security partnerships; Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas announced a new EU-India defense partnership covering maritime security, counterterrorism, and cyber defense.[^6][^7][^8][^9]

**Greenland Sovereignty Discussions**

Trump reiterated at Davos that he will "not use force" to acquire Greenland but indicated ongoing strategic military discussions. According to NATO officials, Trump's strategy may involve transferring Arctic land to the US for new military bases, strengthening NATO's Arctic posture while heightening tensions over sovereignty.[^10][^11][^12]

## 2. AI and Tech Dimensions

**AGI Timeline Narrowing; Job Displacement Warnings**

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive within "a few years, not decades," reaffirming his prediction that AGI will emerge by 2026 or 2027. Amodei noted that AI is already automating software engineering roles within Anthropic, with developers no longer writing code but instead editing AI-generated output. He predicted up to half of entry-level professional jobs could disappear within a decade, warning that "white-collar" work faces significant disruption. Amodei argued that "not selling chips to China is one of the biggest things we can do" to ensure time to manage AGI's development, citing concern over the US selling Nvidia H200 chips to China.[^13][^14][^15]

**Optimism Tempered by Labor Market Reality**

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis offered a more optimistic view, expecting "new, more meaningful jobs being created" and suggesting a slowdown in internships would be "compensated by amazing tools for everyone." However, he cautioned that "five to ten years is not a lot of time" for adaptation, suggesting even pessimistic economists may underestimate transition speed.[^14][^16][^13]

**Infrastructure Investment and Scaling Challenges**

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang participated in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on January 21, emphasizing that massive infrastructure investment is necessary to build the foundation for all layers of AI development above the semiconductor infrastructure layer. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned that the AI boom risks becoming a "bubble" if focus shifts from real-world application and productivity gains to mere hype. Nadella stated: "We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes outcomes of people, communities, countries and industries."[^17][^18][^19][^20][^13]

**Elon Musk on AGI and Post-Scarcity**

Elon Musk predicted that "we might have AI smarter than any human by the end of this year, I would say no later than next year" and expressed confidence that "everyone will have a robot" and "there'll be abundance for all," potentially solving poverty and enabling high living standards.[^13]

**Regulatory Agility and Governance**

The WEF emphasized the need for "agile AI governance" that adapts in real-time rather than through periodic compliance cycles. The forum highlighted initiatives such as Singapore's Global AI Assurance Pilot and the Hiroshima AI Process, underscoring cross-sector collaboration for AI risk assessment.[^21][^22]

## 3. Gossip and People

**On-the-Ground Buzz and Controversies**

Two fires broke out at Davos on January 22 evening—one at the Congress Centre while Trump was present (no injuries), and another at a fondue hut near a hotel requiring temporary evacuation of guests. The Trump administration reportedly prevented California Governor Gavin Newsom from speaking at a planned Fortune-sponsored session, citing White House pressure, though Newsom's office characterized it as a logistical convoy issue.[^23]

**Protest Activity and "No Kings" Symbolism**

Around 600 protesters marched through alpine villages en route to Davos, organized by the "Strike-WEF" collective, carrying placards demanding "Democracy rather than WEF dictatorship." On the evening of January 20, activists illuminated the phrase "No Kings" above Davos using 450 torches on Grüniberg, a statement by residents against rising autocracy and imperialism.[^24][^23]

**High-Profile Bilateral Meetings**

Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during a luncheon event on January 22, signaling tech engagement with Asian financial centers. Chan participated in multiple networking sessions and held bilateral meetings with Cambodia's Deputy PM Sun Chanthol and the UAE's Minister of State for Financial Affairs Mohamed bin Hadi Al Hussaini.[^25]

**International Rescue Committee Criticism**

IRC President David Miliband critiqued the WEF for overlooking humanitarian crises, telling DPA: "There were gaps in Davos when it came to global issues… participants were focused on themselves and their problems."[^23]

**Argentina's Milei: Free-Market Messaging**

President Javier Milei delivered a notably restrained speech compared to Trump's theatrics, declaring "Machiavelli is dead" and emphasizing the moral case for free-enterprise capitalism. He announced Argentina's joining Trump's Board of Peace and echoed Trump's "make [country] great again" messaging.[^26][^27]
