# WEF Davos 2026: The Full Synthesis

*January 20-24, 2026 | Davos-Klosters, Switzerland*

**Theme:** "A Spirit of Dialogue"
**Reality:** A Spirit of Rupture

---

## Executive Summary

The 56th World Economic Forum was marketed as a gathering for cooperative dialogue in an age of uncertainty. What emerged instead was the most explicit display of great-power confrontation, transatlantic fracture, and the definitive burial of the post-WWII "rules-based international order" since the forum's founding.

Trump dominated. Climate vanished. AI infrastructure became the new oil. And the 3,000 attendees—64 heads of state, 830 CEOs, and their private jets—watched the mythology of multilateralism collapse in real-time while eating wagyu beef flown from Japan.

**What actually happened:**
- The Greenland crisis exposed NATO as a protection racket, not an alliance of values
- Ukraine peace talks progressed to "one issue remaining" (but don't hold your breath)
- AGI timelines narrowed to 2026-2028 according to Anthropic/DeepMind/Musk
- The EU pivoted hard toward India as insurance against American unreliability
- Climate sessions dropped from 16 (2022) to 4 (2026)—replaced by crypto lounges and AI Houses
- ~850 private jets descended on Zurich, with 216 aircraft on the ramp simultaneously

## 1. Geopolitics: The Death of the Rules-Based Order

### The Greenland Crisis

Trump's demand to "acquire" Greenland wasn't diplomatic theater—it was a live demonstration of how America now views alliances: transactionally, with tariffs as leverage. The sequence:

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 1 | Trump threatens 10% tariffs on Denmark + EU allies if they refuse to negotiate Greenland transfer |
| Day 2 | Trump's Davos speech: "I won't use force" (collective sigh of relief); framework deal announced with NATO's Rutte |
| Day 3 | Macron declines "Board of Peace" → Trump threatens 200% tariff on French wine |
| Day 4 | Trump departs; transatlantic relationship in shambles |

The resolution changed nothing substantively—the "framework deal" could have been achieved through normal diplomacy without threatening invasion. But the damage was done. As Mark Carney put it: **"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. The old order is not coming back."**

### The "Board of Peace" Farce

Trump's alternative to the UN for conflict resolution drew mockery from all sides:
- **Elon Musk:** "Board of Peace or Board of *Piece*—a little piece of Greenland, a little piece of Venezuela"
- **Membership:** Apparently available for $1 billion—less a diplomatic body, more a country club
- **Canada:** Invited, then disinvited after Carney's criticism ("Canada doesn't live because of the United States")

### Ukraine: Progress Without Guarantees

Witkoff (Trump's envoy) claimed negotiations were down to "one issue." Trilateral talks scheduled for January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. Zelenskyy's assessment: "Documents nearly ready... but faith is not enough."

The Venezuela contrast was unavoidable. Trump deployed sophisticated military operations to capture Maduro (January 3) and now controls Venezuelan oil licensing. Ukraine receives... secondary personnel and ambiguous commitments. The hierarchy is clear.

### Middle Powers Find Their Voice

The forum's most substantive outcome: middle powers openly articulating life after American hegemony.

| Leader | Key Quote |
|--------|-----------|
| **Carney (Canada)** | "The rules-based order was a shimmering artifice designed to give a sheen of legitimacy to great-power self-interest" |
| **Merz (Germany)** | "Our fate is in our hands—it's our responsibility to shape it" |
| **von der Leyen (EU)** | "Nostalgia will not bring back the old order" |

The EU-India trade deal—"the mother of all deals" creating a 2-billion-person market—was the clearest signal of strategic diversification away from American dependence.

## 2. AI & Tech: Infrastructure as Geopolitics

### AGI Timeline Consensus

The technologists converged on a tighter window than ever:

| Source | Prediction |
|--------|------------|
| **Amodei (Anthropic)** | AGI by 2026-2027; "a few years, not decades" |
| **Hassabis (DeepMind)** | More cautious but agreed 5-10 years is "not a lot of time" |
| **Musk** | "AI smarter than any human by end of 2026, no later than next year" |

Amodei's bombshell: **Anthropic developers no longer write code—they edit AI output.** Software engineering is "automatable within 12 months." Half of entry-level professional jobs could disappear within a decade.

### The Infrastructure Arms Race

AI's power demands are staggering:
- Global data center electricity demand to double to 945 TWh by 2030
- AI could increase US power consumption by 60-80% by 2050
- Jensen Huang: "The largest infrastructure buildout in human history"

Major deals announced:

| Deal | Value | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| Tata AI Innovation City (Maharashtra) | $11B | Hyperscale data center + AI campus |
| Saudi HUMAIN/Infra financing | $1.2B | 250 MW AI data center capacity |
| Gates-OpenAI "Horizon1000" | $50M | AI for 1,000 African health clinics by 2028 |

The strategic implication: **AI infrastructure is the new oil.** Countries without sovereign compute capacity will be economically colonized.

### The Export Control Debate

Amodei's position: Exporting advanced AI chips to China is equivalent to "selling nukes to North Korea." The House advanced a bill giving Congress more authority over AI chip exports. The consensus among American tech leaders: compute is too strategically important to trade freely.

### The Job Creation Mantra

IBM's Rob Thomas: AI has matured to where companies can "genuinely begin to automate" and see returns. Gates suggested taxing AI activities to support displaced workers.

The WEF's own analysis presented four scenarios for 2030, ranging from "supercharged progress" (workers adapt quickly) to "age of displacement" (mass unemployment and social division). The forum offered no guidance on which scenario was more likely—or what to do about it.

## 3. Economics: What Actually Got Done

### Concrete Deals

| Announcement | Value | Credibility |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| UK investment commitments | £1.5B+ | Signed (M&G social fund, UCB R&D) |
| Ukraine House investment deals | €350M | Committed (Horizon Capital, Dragon Capital) |
| EU-Mercosur trade agreement | — | Ratification pending |
| EU-India trade deal | — | "On the cusp" (finalization post-Davos) |

### Vague Commitments (The Usual)

Much of Davos remained what it always is: announcements designed to generate headlines rather than binding action. Historical analysis shows a significant portion of Davos commitments fail to fully materialize or are renegotiated substantially.

The Matt Damon "Get Blue" water initiative (Gap, Amazon, Starbucks) was classic Davos: business-led solutions positioned as addressing global challenges while critics argue they displace government responsibility.

## 4. The Sidelining of Climate

The agenda shift was stark:

| Year | Climate Sessions |
|------|------------------|
| 2022 | 16 |
| 2026 | 4 |

What replaced climate? **AI Houses, crypto lounges, and national power hubs.** Gender equity and global health sessions played to half-empty rooms.

Trump made the position explicit: the "Green New Scam" is "the greatest hoax in history." The US would shut down wind energy programs and pursue "historic" natural gas extraction.

The paradox: AI was simultaneously discussed as a tool for environmental optimization while acknowledged as consuming electricity at scales that threaten climate commitments. This contradiction received no substantive discussion.

## 5. Gossip & People

### The Moments Everyone Talked About

| Moment | Context |
|--------|---------|
| **Macron's aviators** | Blue mirrored sunglasses (hiding eye hemorrhage) dominated photos; Italian manufacturer's stock up 65% |
| **Lagarde walkout** | ECB chief left dinner during Lutnick's "vituperative" attack on European competitiveness |
| **Trump-Carney fight** | Canada uninvited from "Board of Peace" after Carney's criticism |
| **Musk's surprise appearance** | Thursday 4:30 p.m. address; mocked Trump's Board of Peace |
| **Air Force One malfunction** | Electrical issue forced switch to backup 757; chaos at Zurich Airport |

### Private Jet Armada

- **850 private jet movements** (Jan 19-21)
- **216 aircraft on ramp simultaneously**
- Contingency plans activated; overnight parking diverted to military airfield
- Greenpeace: 70% of routes could have been traveled by train

### The Protests

- 600 marchers through alpine villages ("No Profit from War")
- "NO KING" carved in snow above Davos
- "NO KINGS" lit with 450 torches on Grüniberg
- Protesters burned US flags in Zurich
- Scammers sold fake VIP passes to USA House—organizers compared volume to "the fastest selling fiction about Davos since Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain"

### The Oxfam Report

- Billionaire wealth hit $18.3 trillion (3,000+ billionaires globally for first time)
- 12 richest billionaires now own more than the poorest 4 billion people
- Billionaires 4,000x more likely to hold political office than ordinary citizens
- 77% of surveyed millionaires believe the super-rich have excessive political influence

## 6. Critical Perspectives Across the Spectrum

### Left Critique

Oxfam, Amnesty, and progressive economists framed Davos as an oligarch summit: extreme wealth concentration purchasing political influence, media control, and legal systems to defend fortunes and dismantle social protections.

An open letter from nearly 400 millionaires (including Mark Ruffalo, Abigail Disney): "When even millionaires like us recognise that extreme wealth is detrimental to everyone else, there is no doubt that society is dangerously teetering on the brink of collapse."

### Right/Libertarian Critique

Concerns about globalist overreach and the coordination of international elites to impose progressive values through international institutions. Trump's presence essentially embodied this critique—rejecting appeals to universal principles in favor of naked national interest.

### Centrist Business Press

Oscillating between acknowledging Davos's continued relevance as a convening mechanism and questioning whether it can maintain credibility. Adam Tooze's analysis: Larry Fink's leadership represents an attempt to "concert governments from around the world, together with a large block of finance capital and key representatives of big tech in the hope of containing MAGA's rampage."

---

## 7. The Institutional Transition

This was the first Davos in 45 years without Klaus Schwab, pushed out in April 2025 after a whistleblower investigation. His replacement—Larry Fink—represents a reorientation "toward economics" rather than Schwab's aspirational stakeholder capitalism.

Fink's opening remarks acknowledged Davos was "out of step with the moment"—"elites in an age of populism" and "an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust." He conceded: "There's truth in that critique."

The rhetorical shift: from defending moral authority to acknowledging the legitimacy crisis.

## A Sarcastic Interpretation: What Davos Actually Is

**The official narrative:** A gathering of global leaders committed to improving the state of the world through dialogue and cooperation.

**What actually happens:**

1. **The Jets** — 850 private aircraft converge on a Swiss Alpine resort to discuss sustainable development. The carbon footprint of this "climate-conscious" convening could power a small city.

2. **The Prices** — $50,000+ for a badge. $1,200/night for a converted storage closet. The message is clear: exclusivity is the product.

3. **The Speeches** — Heads of state deliver carefully crafted addresses about "dialogue" while their actual negotiations happen in side rooms that attendees pay extra to access.

4. **The Side Events** — The "real Davos" runs 7:30am-10:00pm across 50+ venues: Japan Night with wagyu flown from Tokyo, Saudi House with kingdom-building ambitions, AI House where the future is already being sold.

5. **The Deals** — Some real, many aspirational. The ones that matter are announced elsewhere. What gets announced at Davos is often what's meant to be seen.

6. **The Protests** — Carefully managed to be visible enough to provide moral legitimacy ("see, we allow criticism!") but never disruptive enough to interrupt the fondue.

7. **The Theme** — This year: "A Spirit of Dialogue." The actual spirit: transactional power politics, tariff threats, and alliance fractures that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.

**The real function of Davos:**

It's not a governing body. It's not even primarily a networking event (that's a secondary benefit). Davos is a **legitimacy laundry**—a place where the exercise of concentrated power gets rebranded as "stakeholder capitalism" and "public-private partnership."

The forum exists to give the appearance of deliberation to decisions already made, to provide a veneer of multilateral consensus to arrangements negotiated bilaterally, and to allow powerful actors to be seen caring about global problems while their actual business continues unchanged.

When Trump dominated Davos with tariff threats and territorial demands, he wasn't breaking the forum's rules—he was exposing what was always underneath. The "rules-based international order" that Davos purported to represent was always power politics with better PR.

Carney said the quiet part loud: the old order was "a shimmering artifice of norms and institutions designed to give a sheen of legitimacy to the self-interest of powerful states."

Davos didn't create that system. But for 56 years, it's been the system's most successful marketing event.
