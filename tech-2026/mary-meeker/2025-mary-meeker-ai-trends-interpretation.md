# Mary Meeker: AI Trends 2025 — Interpretation

## Overview

Mary Meeker's first report in 5 years. 340 slides dedicated entirely to AI — a departure from her classic "Internet Trends" format. The report is data-heavy and captures the moment when AI went from experiment to infrastructure.

## Key Themes

### Unprecedented Pace
The word "unprecedented" appears on 51 pages. Meeker documents:
- ChatGPT: 800M weekly users in 17 months (fastest ramp in history)
- 2 months to 100M users (vs TikTok 9 months, Instagram 2.5 years)

### Computational Labor Unit
Meeker introduces the concept of one human + multiple AI agents as a new productivity unit. This framing is important — it's not replacement, it's multiplication.

### Real Enterprise Adoption
Concrete examples:
- **Klarna:** AI bot handles 2/3 of customer chats, saving 700 FTEs
- **Kaiser Permanente:** 10,000+ doctors using AI medical scribe
- AI SDRs handling 80% of outbound in early-stage SaaS

### China Competition
- China leads in open-source AI model releases (3 large-scale in 2025)
- DeepSeek: 0% → 21% global LLM user share in months
- AI supremacy tied to geopolitical leadership

## Bias Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| **Commercial Bias** | MEDIUM |
| **Technical Depth** | 4/5 |
| **Actionable Insights** | 4/5 |
| **Novel Ideas** | 4/5 |

Meeker has VC bias (Bond Capital) but her reports are historically rigorous and data-driven. Less product pitch, more macro analysis.

## Key Takeaways

- **"Computational labor unit"** is a useful mental model for workforce planning
- **Adoption data** is the most valuable part — concrete numbers, not predictions
- **China section** is important counterweight to US-centric reports
- **Enterprise case studies** show where AI is actually delivering ROI

## Cross-Reference

- Aligns with: KPMG (workforce transformation), CB Insights (ROI challenges)
- Unique value: Historical data perspective, adoption benchmarks
- Contrasts: More optimistic than Forrester on near-term impact

## Why Include a 2025 Report?

1. Meeker's reports are canonical tech references
2. This is her AI-focused pivot after 5-year hiatus
3. Data benchmarks remain relevant for 2026 context
4. No 2026 version available yet
