## Essence of the Report

Forrester's 2026 predictions take a notably contrarian stance compared to other analyst firms. While most reports hype AI acceleration, Forrester predicts significant slowdowns, deferrals, and risks. This is their brand positioning — the skeptical voice in a hype-driven market.

The core thesis: enterprises will hit the ROI wall in 2026. CFOs will demand financial proof before approving AI investments, killing many proofs of concept. The "everything AI" enthusiasm of 2024-2025 will face a cold financial reckoning.

The report makes specific, falsifiable predictions with numbers — 25% of AI spend deferred, neoclouds grabbing $20B, developer hiring time doubling. This specificity is unusual and makes the predictions trackable.

Most provocatively, they predict an agentic AI deployment will cause a public breach leading to employee dismissals. This security warning stands out against the generally positive agent coverage elsewhere.

## Key Findings

### AI Reality Check
- 25% of planned AI spend will be deferred to 2027
- Fewer than 1/3 of decision-makers can tie AI value to financial growth
- CFOs will demand ROI before approving AI investments

### Infrastructure Shifts
- Neoclouds (CoreWeave, Lambda) will grab $20B in revenue from hyperscalers
- Private AI factories will reach 20% adoption
- On-premises servers will capture 50% share as enterprises seek control

### Talent & Organization
- Time to fill developer positions will double
- A third of CIOs will adopt gig-worker protocols for multi-job IT employees
- As AI handles junior tasks, demand shifts to senior architects

### Security Warnings
- An agentic AI deployment will cause a public breach and lead to employee dismissals
- Quantum security spending will exceed 5% of IT security budget

## Who Benefits?

**Author type:** Analyst Firm

**What they're selling:** Research subscriptions, advisory services

**How predictions align with interests:**
- Contrarian predictions generate media attention and differentiation from Gartner
- "Told you so" moments build credibility for future subscription sales
- Fear-based security predictions drive security research purchases
- CFO focus creates demand for ROI-focused research

The contrarian positioning is strategic — in a market of AI boosters, being the skeptic stands out.

## Bias Scorecard

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Commercial Bias** | MEDIUM | Drives subscriptions but less product-tied than vendors |
| **Technical Depth** | 2/5 | Predictions, not architectures |
| **Actionable Insights** | 3/5 | Specific numbers allow planning |
| **Novel Ideas** | 4/5 | Contrarian takes are refreshing in hype cycle |

## Cross-Reference

- **Aligns with:** Galloway (AI skepticism), CB Insights (ROI concerns)
- **Conflicts with:** Google Cloud (bullish on agents), KPMG (aggressive adoption claims), Microsoft (AI acceleration)
- **Unique angles:** Neocloud disruption thesis, specific breach prediction, AI spend deferral quantified

## Bottom Line

Forrester is the skeptical counterweight to vendor hype. The "25% AI spend deferred" and "agentic breach" predictions are bold and specific. If you're building 2026 plans, these are the risks to stress-test against. The contrarian positioning serves their business, but the skepticism is warranted given industry track record.
