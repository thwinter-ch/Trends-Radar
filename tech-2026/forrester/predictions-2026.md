## Key Predictions

### AI Reality Check

**"25% of planned AI spend will be deferred to 2027"**
- Fewer than 1/3 of decision-makers can tie AI value to financial growth
- CFOs will demand ROI before approving AI investments
- Financial rigor will kill proofs of concept

**What they're selling:** Forrester research to help justify (or kill) AI investments.

### Infrastructure Shifts

**"Neoclouds will grab $20B in revenue"**
Specialized cloud providers focusing on high-performance GPUs for AI workloads will erode hyperscaler dominance.

**"Private AI factories will reach 20% adoption"**
On-premises servers will capture 50% share as enterprises seek control.

### Talent & Organization

**"Time to fill developer positions will double"**
As AI handles junior tasks, demand shifts to senior architects who can integrate human expertise with AI.

**"A third of CIOs will adopt gig-worker protocols for multi-job IT employees"**

### Security Warnings

**"An agentic AI deployment will cause a public breach and lead to employee dismissals"**
This is the boldest prediction — specific, falsifiable, consequential.

**"Quantum security spending will exceed 5% of IT security budget"**
Harvest-now-decrypt-later threats driving urgency.

## Commercial Bias Analysis

### Why This Report Exists

Forrester competes with Gartner for research subscriptions. Their angle:
1. More contrarian/provocative predictions to stand out
2. Creates "told you so" moments that drive credibility
3. Fear-based predictions drive security research sales

### The Contrarian Play

While others hype AI, Forrester says "25% deferred." This differentiation is strategic — they're positioning as the skeptical voice.

### What's Genuinely Useful

- **AI spend deferral** is a real phenomenon worth watching
- **Neoclouds** (CoreWeave, Lambda, etc.) are genuinely disrupting
- **The breach prediction** is specific enough to be useful
- **Developer hiring doubling** has workforce planning implications

---

## What's Missing

- Which specific AI investments will be cut vs. kept
- How to identify "good" AI spend vs. "bad"
- Neocloud risks (stability, lock-in)
- What triggers the predicted breach

## Rating

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Commercial Bias | **Medium** | Drives research subscriptions |
| Technical Depth | **2/5** | Predictions, not architectures |
| Actionable Insights | **3/5** | Some specific enough to plan around |
| Novelty | **4/5** | Contrarian takes are refreshing |

---

## Bottom Line

Forrester's predictions are more provocative than Gartner's. The "AI spend deferral" and "breach from agentic AI" calls are bold and specific. If you're building 2026 plans, these are the risks to stress-test against. The contrarian positioning serves their business, but the skepticism is warranted.
