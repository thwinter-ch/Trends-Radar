## Essence of the Report

Capgemini's tech trends report brings a distinctly European perspective to the 2026 landscape. As a French-headquartered consultancy with strong European presence, their emphasis on technology sovereignty and data localization reflects their client base's regulatory environment.

The report positions AI as the "backbone" of enterprise digital infrastructure — a shift from AI as point solution to AI as foundational layer. This "AI-native operations" framing aligns with broader industry evolution but emphasizes governance and control.

"Cloud 3.0" captures the next evolution: hybrid/multi-cloud, edge integration, and AI-optimized infrastructure. This positions Capgemini's cloud transformation services.

The "dual-use defense technology" angle is unique — commercial applications of defense tech and vice versa. This geopolitical lens is underexplored in US-centric reports and relevant for European clients navigating US-China-EU dynamics.

Technology sovereignty emerges as a central theme: data localization, regional AI capabilities, reduced dependence on foreign tech. This aligns with Gartner's "geopatriation" concept and IBM's sovereignty emphasis, but from a European service provider perspective.

## Key Findings

### AI Backbone
AI as foundational infrastructure rather than point solution. Shift from "AI projects" to "AI-native operations." Governance and control emphasis.

### Intelligent Applications
Evolution of applications with embedded AI capabilities. Standard enterprise software trajectory with AI integration.

### Cloud 3.0
Next evolution of cloud computing:
- Hybrid/multi-cloud architectures
- Edge integration
- AI-optimized infrastructure

### Dual-Use Defense Technology
Commercial applications of defense tech and vice versa. Geopolitical angle underexplored elsewhere.

### Technology Sovereignty
- Data localization requirements
- Regional AI capabilities
- Reduced dependence on foreign tech
- European regulatory compliance

## Who Benefits?

**Author type:** Big Consultancy (European-headquartered)

**What they're selling:** Digital transformation consulting, cloud services, AI implementation

**How predictions align with interests:**
- "AI backbone" = foundation transformation consulting
- "Cloud 3.0" = cloud migration and optimization services
- "Technology sovereignty" = European compliance consulting
- "Dual-use defense" = government/defense sector positioning

The sovereignty angle serves European clients facing GDPR, AI Act, and other regional requirements — Capgemini's home market.

## Bias Scorecard

## Cross-Reference

- **Aligns with:** Gartner (geopatriation), IBM (sovereignty), European regulatory landscape
- **Conflicts with:** US vendor reports that minimize sovereignty concerns
- **Unique angles:** Defense technology dual-use, European regulatory perspective, sovereignty as central theme

## Bottom Line

Capgemini brings European perspective to tech trends — sovereignty, data localization, and regulatory compliance feature prominently. The defense tech dual-use angle is underexplored elsewhere and geopolitically relevant. Read it for European market perspective and sovereignty considerations.
