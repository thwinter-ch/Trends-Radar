## Consensus Themes

### 1. Agentic AI Is THE Story of 2026

**Who's saying it:** Everyone.

| Source | Framing |
|--------|---------|
| Google Cloud | "Agents for every employee, workflow, customer, security, scale" |
| Deloitte | "Silicon-based workforce" — preparing for human-AI hybrid |
| Gartner | "Multiagent Systems" — modular agents collaborating |
| a16z | "Agent-native infrastructure" — recursive, bursty workloads |
| KPMG | 88% already embedding agents |
| Forrester | Warning: "Agentic AI will cause a public breach" |

**Signal strength:** Very High. Universal agreement, but Forrester adds important caution.

### 2. AI Infrastructure Becomes CEO-Level

**Who's saying it:** Deloitte, Gartner, Forrester, IBM

| Source | Framing |
|--------|---------|
| Deloitte | "Computation is a CEO-level strategic conversation" |
| Gartner | "AI Supercomputing Platforms" — hybrid computing paradigms |
| Forrester | "Neoclouds grab $20B" — specialized AI cloud providers |
| Forrester | "Private AI factories at 20% adoption" |

**Signal strength:** High. Infrastructure decisions moving from IT to boardroom.

### 3. Security Paradox: AI as Threat AND Defense

**Who's saying it:** Deloitte, Gartner, Forrester, a16z

| Source | Framing |
|--------|---------|
| Deloitte | "AI Cybersecurity Paradox" — same tech creates and defends vulnerabilities |
| Gartner | "Preemptive Cybersecurity" + "AI Security Platforms" |
| Forrester | Predicts breach from agentic AI deployment |
| a16z | AI closes cybersecurity hiring gap |

**Signal strength:** High. Security is both opportunity and risk.

### 4. The ROI Reckoning

**Who's saying it:** Forrester, CB Insights, Deloitte

| Source | Framing |
|--------|---------|
| Forrester | "25% of AI spend deferred to 2027" |

**Signal strength:** Medium-High. The contrarian view gaining traction.

### 5. Sovereignty & Geopatriation

**Who's saying it:** Gartner, IBM

| Source | Framing |
|--------|---------|
| Gartner | "Geopatriation" — workloads moving to local/sovereign infrastructure |
| IBM | "93% must factor AI sovereignty into 2026 strategy" |
