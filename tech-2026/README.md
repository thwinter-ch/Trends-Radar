## Emerging Themes

*Updated as reports are analyzed.*

### 1. Agentic AI Goes Mainstream

**Who's saying it:** Google Cloud (heavily)

**The claim:** 2026 is the year AI agents move from demos to production. Agents for employees, workflows, customers, security, operations.

**The commercial angle:** Cloud providers want agent workloads. Agents are compute-intensive, API-heavy, storage-hungry. "Agents everywhere" = cloud revenue growth.

**What's actually happening:** Agent frameworks have matured (LangChain, AutoGPT successors, vendor tools). Early enterprise deployments showing results. But "agents for everything" oversells current reliability.

**Signal strength:** Medium-High. The direction is real; the timeline is aggressive.

### 2. [Theme TBD]
