## Key Ideas (17 Partners, 7 Areas)

### AI & Infrastructure

**Interactive AI Video**
Video stops being passive — models understand time, remember context, react to input. Characters persist, physics hold, consequences unfold.

**Agent-Native Infrastructure**
Shift from human-speed traffic to "agent-speed" workloads — recursive, bursty, massive. The biggest infrastructure shock comes from within.

**Multi-Agent Systems**
Enterprises shift from isolated AI tools to coordinated digital teams managing interdependent workflows.

### Enterprise Disruption

**System of Record Loses Primacy**
AI collapses distance between intent and execution. Models read, write, reason directly across operational data. ITSM and CRM become autonomous workflow engines.

**AI-Native University**
First institution built from ground up around intelligent systems expected in 2026.

### Physical World

**American Manufacturing Renaissance**
Rebirth of the factory with software and AI at its heart. Modular deployment of AI and autonomy alongside skilled workers.

### Crypto & Finance

**Origination, Not Just Tokenization**
Stablecoins went mainstream in 2025. 2026 sees native crypto financial instruments.

**zkVM Provers Hit 10,000X Overhead**
Fast enough to run on phones, cheap enough to run everywhere. Single GPU generates proofs of CPU execution in real time.

### Security

**AI Closes the Cybersecurity Hiring Gap**
Automating repetitive work frees security teams for actual threat hunting.

## Commercial Bias Analysis

### Why This Report Exists

a16z is a VC firm. Big Ideas:
1. Validates their investment thesis publicly
2. Signals to founders what they want to fund
3. Positions portfolio companies as trend leaders
4. Creates deal flow

### The Portfolio Alignment

Every "big idea" maps to current or desired portfolio companies. "American manufacturing renaissance" = investments in robotics/automation. "Agent-native infrastructure" = investments in AI infra startups.

### What's Genuinely Useful

- **AI video becoming interactive** is a genuinely novel framing
- **System of record losing primacy** is a bold enterprise call
- **zkVM progress** is technically specific and verifiable
- **Multi-partner format** provides diverse perspectives

## What's Missing

- Failure modes — what if these ideas don't pan out?
- Timelines beyond "2026"
- Competitive dynamics — who loses?
- Regulatory headwinds

## Rating

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Commercial Bias | **High** | Directly supports portfolio thesis |
| Technical Depth | **4/5** | Partner expertise shows |
| Actionable Insights | **3/5** | Good for founders, less for operators |
| Novelty | **4/5** | Several genuinely fresh takes |

## Bottom Line

a16z's Big Ideas is a VC firm telling you what they want to fund. That bias is obvious but the content is substantive — these are smart people with skin in the game. The "interactive AI video" and "system of record disruption" calls are worth tracking. Read it to understand where smart money is flowing, not as neutral trend analysis.
