## Essence of the Report

PwC's 29th Annual Global CEO Survey delivers the most sobering data point of the 2026 reporting cycle: **only 12% of CEOs report achieving both cost and revenue benefits from AI**. An additional 33% cite gains in either cost OR revenue, but 56% have yet to see meaningful financial returns. This is the ROI reckoning that vendor reports avoid and consultancies whisper about.

The survey reveals a confidence crisis: only 30% of CEOs express confidence in revenue growth prospects—down from 38% in 2025 and 56% in 2022. This three-year decline suggests that post-pandemic optimism has given way to operational reality.

But here's the pattern PwC surfaces: **the 12% achieving dual benefits are 2-3x more likely to have embedded AI extensively across products, services, and decision-making**. This isn't a technology problem—it's an integration depth problem. Pilots don't deliver ROI. Enterprise-wide deployment does.

The survey also flags emerging risk priorities: cybersecurity concerns jumped from 24% to 31% of CEOs, while 20% now report high exposure to tariff-related losses. These aren't hypothetical risks—they're operational realities reshaping strategy in 2026.

Survey methodology: 4,454 CEOs across 95 countries (September 30 - November 10, 2025). This is one of the largest executive samples in the trend report landscape, giving the data statistical credibility.

## Key Findings

### The 12% ROI Reality
- Only **12% of CEOs** report both cost AND revenue benefits from AI
- **33%** cite gains in either cost or revenue (not both)
- **56%** have yet to see meaningful financial returns
- Pattern: Dual-benefit achievers are **2-3x more likely** to have embedded AI extensively across operations

### CEO Confidence Crisis
- Only **30%** confident in revenue growth prospects (down from 38% in 2025, 56% in 2022)
- Three-year confidence decline suggests structural pessimism, not cyclical
- Confidence at five-year low despite ongoing AI investment

### Risk Landscape Shift
- **Cybersecurity:** 31% now cite as major threat (up from 24%)
- **Tariffs:** 20% report high exposure to tariff-related financial loss
- **Geopolitical risks:** Increasing concerns reshape investment strategies

### Integration Depth Matters
- **Strong Responsible AI frameworks** correlate with 3x higher ROI realization
- **Enterprise-wide integration** beats departmental pilots
- **Foundational infrastructure** (data quality, governance) predicts financial returns

## Who Benefits?

**Author type:** Big Four consultancy (PwC)

**What they're selling:**
- AI transformation consulting (strategy, implementation, governance)
- Responsible AI frameworks and governance services
- Change management and organizational design
- Data infrastructure and analytics consulting
- C-suite advisory and board education

**How predictions align with interests:**

1. **The 12% stat creates urgency without condemning AI** — Most CEOs aren't seeing returns, but the 12% prove it's possible. This validates continued investment while creating demand for "how to be in the 12%" consulting.

2. **"Integration depth" emphasis sells transformation services** — By linking ROI to enterprise-wide deployment (not pilots), PwC positions its transformation practice as essential. This isn't a technology purchase—it's a multi-year consulting engagement.

3. **Responsible AI framework correlation justifies governance practice** — The 3x ROI multiplier for companies with established AI governance frameworks directly supports PwC's AI ethics and governance offerings.

4. **Confidence crisis validates advisory services** — If CEO confidence is at a five-year low, boards need strategic guidance. PwC benefits from uncertainty as much as from AI enthusiasm.

5. **Risk catalog expands service offerings** — Cybersecurity, tariffs, geopolitics—each represents a separate consulting workstream.

**For Big Four consultancies, note actual incentives:**
- Revenue from multi-year transformation programs (most lucrative)
- Positioning as trusted CEO advisor (access to budget)
- Selling governance frameworks (high-margin, recurring)
- Creating urgency without fear (keeps clients investing)

## Bias Scorecard

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Commercial Bias** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Data is credible (large sample), but framing serves PwC's transformation practice; "integration depth" = consulting revenue |
| **Technical Depth** | 2/5 | Survey data, not technical analysis; diagnostic, not prescriptive on implementation |
| **Actionable Insights** | 3/5 | Clear direction (embed extensively, not pilots), but lacks tactical specificity on "how" |
| **Novel Ideas** | 4/5 | The 12% stat is the most honest ROI data in the 2026 cycle; integration depth correlation is signal |

## Cross-Reference

**Aligns with:**
- [Forrester Predictions](../forrester/) — Both emphasize ROI scrutiny; Forrester predicts 25% of AI spend deferred to 2027
- [CB Insights Tech Trends](../cb-insights/) — Both identify "measuring ROI is the hard part"
- [Deloitte Tech Trends](../deloitte/) — Both emphasize "reality check" on scaling vs. piloting
- [BCG AI Radar](../bcg-ai-radar/) — Contrast: BCG shows 82% more optimistic on ROI (surveyed execs vs. CEOs = different frames)

**Conflicts with:**
- [Google Cloud AI Agents](../google-cloud/) — Google: "2026 businesses won't ask whether to adopt"; PwC: 56% see no benefit yet
- [KPMG Global Tech Report](../kpmg/) — KPMG: "88% already embedding agents"; PwC: only 12% seeing dual benefits
- [a16z Big Ideas](../a16z/) — VC optimism vs. CEO reality check

**Unique angles:**
- **12% dual-benefit stat:** Most honest ROI data in the trend report cycle; vendors won't publish this
- **3-year confidence decline:** (56% → 38% → 30%) shows structural pessimism, not just 2026 concern
- **Integration depth > pilot proliferation:** Tactical insight that contradicts "experiment broadly" narrative from vendors

## Bottom Line

**Read it for:** The 12% ROI stat is the reality check every other report avoids. If you're a CEO wondering why AI isn't delivering yet, this data says you're in the majority (56%). The integration depth correlation is also actionable—pilots don't scale to ROI.

**Skip it for:** Technical implementation details or tactical AI strategy. This is CEO-level survey data, not a playbook.

**Filter for:** PwC's commercial interest in transformation consulting. The message is: "AI works, but only if you do it right (which requires our help)." That's not dishonest, but it's designed to keep budgets flowing toward multi-year engagements.

**Key insight:** The 12% who achieve dual benefits are 2-3x more likely to have embedded AI extensively. This suggests ROI correlates with scope and depth, not just technology selection. Most organizations are under-investing in integration and over-investing in pilots.

**Bias check:** PwC benefits from both AI enthusiasm (sells transformation) and AI skepticism (sells advisory). The 12% stat creates perfect tension: disappointing enough to need help, promising enough to justify investment. That's not accidental—it's strategic survey framing.

**Bottom line for strategists:** If 56% of CEOs see no financial benefit and only 12% see dual benefits, the market is massively over-rotated toward hype relative to execution capability. Either the technology isn't ready for most use cases, or most organizations lack the infrastructure/integration capability to capture value. PwC argues the latter (because it's fixable via consulting). The truth is probably both.
