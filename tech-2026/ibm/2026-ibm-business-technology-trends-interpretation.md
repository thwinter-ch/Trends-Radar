## Essence of the Report

IBM's Institute for Business Value surveyed 1,000+ C-suite executives and 8,500 global consumers/employees to identify 2026 business and technology trends. The report positions two themes as central: quantum computing readiness and AI sovereignty.

On quantum, IBM makes an aggressive timeline claim: "quantum advantage" — the point where quantum computers demonstrably outperform classical methods — will emerge by end of 2026. This is one of the most specific quantum predictions in any major report.

On sovereignty, the report claims 93% of executives factor AI sovereignty into their 2026 business strategy. This encompasses data residency, regulatory compliance, geopolitical risk, and supply chain control. The framing suggests enterprises are moving away from pure public cloud toward hybrid/on-premises approaches.

The dual-sample methodology (executives + consumers/employees) provides organizational depth that pure C-suite surveys lack.

## Key Findings

### Quantum Computing
- Quantum advantage likely to emerge by end of 2026
- Enterprises should prepare for post-quantum cryptography
- The point where quantum provides demonstrable improvement over classical methods

### AI Sovereignty
- 93% of executives factor AI sovereignty into 2026 strategy
- Concerns include data residency, regulatory compliance, geopolitical risk
- Supply chain control becoming strategic priority

### Survey Scope
- 1,000+ C-suite executives surveyed
- 8,500 global consumers and employees surveyed
- Multi-perspective organizational view

## Who Benefits?

**Author type:** Tech Vendor (Enterprise Technology)

**What they're selling:**
- IBM Quantum systems and services
- watsonx enterprise AI platform
- Hybrid cloud infrastructure
- On-premises solutions

**How predictions align with interests:**
- "Quantum advantage by 2026" directly supports IBM's quantum roadmap and investments
- "AI sovereignty" validates hybrid cloud/on-prem positioning against pure hyperscalers
- "93% factoring sovereignty" creates urgency for IBM's enterprise solutions
- Both themes position IBM's specific product offerings as the answer

The report is vendor content dressed as research. Every conclusion points toward IBM's product strategy.

## Bias Scorecard

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Commercial Bias** | HIGH | Quantum + sovereignty = IBM's exact positioning |
| **Technical Depth** | 3/5 | Good on concepts, light on implementation details |
| **Actionable Insights** | 2/5 | Strategic direction without tactical guidance |
| **Novel Ideas** | 3/5 | Quantum + sovereignty combo is distinctive |

## Cross-Reference

- **Aligns with:** Gartner (sovereignty/geopatriation), Capgemini (European sovereignty angle)
- **Conflicts with:** Others on quantum timeline (most don't make specific claims)
- **Unique angles:** Aggressive quantum timeline, large consumer sample, sovereignty quantification

## Bottom Line

IBM's report serves their quantum and hybrid cloud strategy. The quantum timeline claim is aggressive and self-serving. The sovereignty emphasis validates their on-prem positioning against hyperscalers. But the underlying concerns (quantum readiness, data control) are real — just filtered heavily through IBM's commercial lens. Validate these claims through non-vendor sources.
