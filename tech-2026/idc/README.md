## Why This Source Matters

IDC is a peer to Gartner and Forrester — one of the "big three" technology analyst firms. Their FutureScape predictions are widely cited and carry significant weight with enterprise CIOs and IT leadership.

**Unique angle:** IDC quantifies the *workforce impact* of AI agents more directly than other reports (40% of G2000 roles affected), and highlights governance/legal risk explicitly.
