## Commercial Bias Analysis

### Why This Report Exists

Deloitte is the largest professional services firm globally. Their Tech Trends report:
1. Establishes thought leadership to generate consulting leads
2. Creates urgency for enterprise transformation projects
3. Positions Deloitte as the trusted advisor for AI scaling

### The "Scaling" Narrative

Every trend emphasizes moving from "pilots" to "production" — which requires... consultants. The framing of "reality check" acknowledges hype fatigue while still pushing action.

### What's Genuinely Useful

- **The pilot-to-production framing** is honest — most enterprises ARE stuck
- **Security paradox** is a real concern worth executive attention
- **Infrastructure as CEO-level** reflects actual market reality
- **Concrete stats** on market sizing are useful for planning

## What's Missing

- Cost of failure — what happens when AI projects don't scale?
- Open-source alternatives to expensive enterprise solutions
- Skills gap beyond "hire consultants"
- Regulatory uncertainty impact

## Bottom Line

Solid annual report from a consultancy that knows its audience (C-suite). The "reality check" framing is refreshingly honest about AI hype vs. delivery. Read it for the market sizing data and the framework for thinking about AI scaling challenges. Filter the implicit "you need consultants" message.
