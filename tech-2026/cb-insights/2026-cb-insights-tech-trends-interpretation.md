## Essence of the Report

CB Insights approaches trend analysis differently than consultancies — they're a market intelligence platform with actual funding and company data. Their trends are grounded in what's being built and funded, not just executive surveys or partner opinions.

The 2026 report identifies 14 emerging trends shaped by AI deployment across healthcare, finance, energy, robotics, and more. The central theme is honest and refreshing: "AI agents are delivering value, but measuring it is the hard part."

This acknowledges what vendors won't say — autonomy is scaling faster than enterprises' ability to attribute revenue. The ROI measurement challenge is real, and CB Insights surfaces it directly.

The report describes a new operating model emerging across industries: speed, scale, and automation as default. Work measured in new ways. Markets functioning differently. This is evolution, not revolution framing.

## Bottom Line

CB Insights brings a data-driven, startup-focused lens that consultancies lack. The "measuring ROI is the hard part" framing is honest and useful — it's what others won't say. Best for understanding what's being funded and built, not for enterprise implementation guidance. Full access requires subscription, limiting comprehensive analysis.
