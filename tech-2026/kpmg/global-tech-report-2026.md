## Commercial Bias Analysis

### Why This Report Exists

KPMG is one of the Big Four. The Global Tech Report:
1. Positions KPMG as tech-savvy (competing with Deloitte, Accenture)
2. Generates consulting leads for AI/digital transformation
3. Creates data they can cite in pitches

### The "88%" Claim

"88% embedding AI agents" is striking — higher than most surveys. Worth scrutinizing methodology. "Embedding" could mean anything from production deployment to early pilots.

### The Workforce Prediction

"50% permanent human staff by 2027" is provocative. Creates urgency for workforce transformation consulting.

### What's Genuinely Useful

- **Large sample size** (2,500 execs) provides statistical weight
- **Geographic diversity** gives global perspective
- **Specific timeline** (2027) is falsifiable
- **High performer distinction** adds nuance

---

## What's Missing

- Definition of "embedding AI agents"
- How they define "high performers"
- Sector breakdowns
- Regional variations in adoption

## Rating

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Commercial Bias | **Medium-High** | Big Four positioning |
| Technical Depth | **2/5** | Survey data, not technical analysis |
| Actionable Insights | **3/5** | Benchmarking data is useful |
| Novelty | **2/5** | Confirms consensus, few surprises |

## Bottom Line

KPMG's report is valuable for the survey data — 2,500 executives is a meaningful sample. The "88% embedding agents" and "50% human by 2027" stats will be widely cited. Use it for benchmarking and board presentations. Be skeptical of the methodology behind headline numbers.
