## Essence of the Report

KPMG's Global Tech Report 2026 is built on a substantial survey: 2,500 tech executives across 27 countries (43% EMEA, 29% APAC, 28% Americas). The scale and geographic diversity give it statistical weight that smaller surveys lack.

The headline finding is aggressive: "88% of organizations are already embedding AI agents into workflows, products, and value streams." This is higher than most surveys report, raising questions about how "embedding" is defined — early pilots vs. production deployment are very different things.

The workforce prediction is provocative: "High performers expect ~50% of tech teams to be permanent human staff by 2027." Small, durable human cores orchestrating large AI-augmented ecosystems. This creates urgency for workforce transformation conversations.

The report covers agentic AI, quantum computing, and AGI as strategic planning topics — a Big Four firm legitimizing these conversations for board-level audiences.

## Key Findings

### Survey Scope
- 2,500 tech executives surveyed
- 27 countries represented
- 43% EMEA, 29% APAC, 28% Americas

### Headline Statistics
- **88% of organizations** already embedding AI agents into workflows, products, and value streams
- **High performers expect ~50%** of tech teams to be permanent human staff by 2027
- Small, durable human cores orchestrating large AI-augmented ecosystems

### Trends Covered
- **Agentic AI** — Commanding attention, moving from experimentation to deployment
- **Quantum Computing** — On the horizon as next major disruptive force
- **Artificial General Intelligence** — Increasingly part of strategic planning conversations

## Who Benefits?

**Author type:** Big Consultancy (Big Four)

**What they're selling:** Transformation consulting, technology advisory, workforce transition services

**How predictions align with interests:**
- "88% embedding agents" creates urgency — "Are you falling behind?"
- "50% permanent human staff by 2027" drives workforce transformation consulting
- AGI in strategic planning legitimizes executive advisory services
- Geographic diversity validates KPMG's global delivery capability

The aggressive statistics serve lead generation. "High performers" framing creates FOMO for executives not yet at that level.

## Bias Scorecard

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Commercial Bias** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Big Four positioning, aggressive headline stats |
| **Technical Depth** | 2/5 | Survey data, not technical analysis |
| **Actionable Insights** | 3/5 | Benchmarking data is useful for board presentations |
| **Novel Ideas** | 2/5 | Confirms consensus, few surprises beyond headline numbers |

## Cross-Reference

- **Aligns with:** Deloitte (workforce transformation), Google Cloud (agent adoption claims)
- **Conflicts with:** Forrester (more skeptical on AI timelines and ROI)
- **Unique angles:** Large survey sample, geographic diversity, aggressive adoption statistics

## Bottom Line

KPMG's report is valuable for the survey data — 2,500 executives across 27 countries is a meaningful sample. The "88% embedding agents" and "50% human by 2027" stats will be widely cited in pitches and board presentations. Use it for benchmarking, but be skeptical of methodology behind headline numbers. "Embedding" could mean many things.
