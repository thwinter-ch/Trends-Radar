## PDF vs CSV

**CSV**: Raw database (2,251 predictions from 938 sources) - the data layer
**PDF**: Editorial narrative, 2025 timeline, thematic sections (Economy, Markets, Geopolitics, Technology, Society, Climate), Visual Capitalist's curated highlights - the presentation layer

They're complementary. Our interpretation analyzes the CSV for source composition/bias, but acknowledges the PDF provides Visual Capitalist's editorial framing.

## Quick Summary

Visual Capitalist Plus aggregated **2,251 predictions from 938 sources** into a curated database covering financial markets, technology, geopolitics, and sector-specific forecasts. This is a meta-report, not primary research.

**Source Composition:**
- **24%** Investment Banks (Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, UBS)
- **4.4%** Consultancies (Forrester, Deloitte, Gartner, McKinsey, KPMG)
- **3.8%** Institutions/Media (IMF, The Economist, World Bank, Brookings)
- **2%** Individual Experts (Derek Thompson, Scott Galloway, Matt Hougan, John Chambers)
- **66%** Sector Specialists (IATA, Palo Alto, CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield, Acosta, regional banks)

**Top Topics:**
- **Financial Markets** (~40%): Fixed income (47), equities (43), GDP (33), inflation (32), rates (13)
- **AI & Technology** (14%): 318 predictions spanning enterprise adoption, cybersecurity, consumer AI
- **Geopolitics & Trade** (10%): US-China, Europe reindustrialization, Middle East energy
- **Crypto** (0.7%): 16 predictions (minimal coverage despite institutional adoption)
- **Energy & Climate** (2%): IEA cuts renewable forecast by 20%, EV battery dominance (China 60%+)
- **Sector-specific**: Aviation (IATA: 24), Real Estate (Cushman: 30), Healthcare, Retail

**Key Findings:**
1. **Consensus: Slowdown, not recession** — GDP 1.3-2.7%, sticky inflation, cautious Fed
2. **AI adoption claims vs ROI reality** — 70% used AI tools, but only 12% trust AI purchases (Acosta)
3. **Investment banks dominate** — 24% of predictions create financial markets lens
4. **Crypto underrepresented** — 0.7% coverage despite massive retail/institutional interest
5. **IEA cuts renewable forecast 20%** — Energy transition slowing (buried signal)
6. **China underrepresented** — 2% of predictions despite being critical geopolitical risk

**Geographic Focus:**
- Global: 303 predictions (13.5%)
- US: 324 predictions (14.4%)
- Europe: 93 (4.1%)
- China: 47 (2.1%)
- Canada: 52 (2.3%)

**Bias Level:** **MEDIUM**

- **Commercial bias:** MEDIUM — VC+ sells subscriptions; bias is in *curation* (who to include), not predictions themselves. Investment bank overrepresentation reflects subscriber base.
- **Technical depth:** 2/5 — Aggregation = shallow breadth. Most predictions are 1-2 sentences.
- **Actionable insights:** 3/5 — Good for competitive intelligence ("what is Morgan Stanley telling clients?"), less for execution.
- **Novel ideas:** 1/5 — Almost zero. By design, aggregation favors consensus over contrarian views.

**Bottom line:** Best use is **consensus tracking** — understanding what institutional capital believes. Not useful for contrarian insights, deep technical analysis, or crypto/DeFi coverage. Unique value: sector breadth (aviation, real estate, retail) and seeing 938 sources in one place. Curation is Western/US-centric, underweights China and crypto, favors "safe" consensus over tail risks.

**Read it to answer**: "What are investment banks telling their clients?" Not: "What will actually happen?"
